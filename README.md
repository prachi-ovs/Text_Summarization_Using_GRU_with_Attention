# News Articles Summarizations 
Using Bi-directional GRU with Attention mechanism

## Overview
A sequence2sequence Text Summarization model to generate Abstractive summaries of news articles using GRU encoder-decoder and Attention.

## Introduction
Text Summarization is one of those Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications which is sure to have a major impact on our day to day lives.
Text summarization can broadly be divided into two categories: 
   
   1) **Extractive Summarization**: These methods rely on extracting several parts, such as phrases and sentences, from a piece of text and stack them together to create a summary. Therefore, identifying the right sentences for summarization is of utmost importance in an extractive method.
   
   2) **Abstractive Summarization**: These methods use advanced NLP techniques to generate an entirely new summary. Some parts of this summary may not even appear in the original text.
 
## Model Details
The model was run for **x** epochs and the best performing training epoch is saved as the final model.
The *Encoder* takes a sequence of text as input and produces a list of hidden states in each time step. The list of hidden layers is the input to the *Decoder* along with the token *sos* (to indicate start of statement) and hidden states. Attention takes the current *decoderâ€™s* hidden state and the list of *encoder* hidden states to calculate the Attention score and creates a context vector based on this score. The context vector and the *decoder* output are concatenated and passed to a *fully connected feedforward layer* to generate the output. These steps are repeated until either the maximum sentence length is achieved or the *eos* is predicted.
